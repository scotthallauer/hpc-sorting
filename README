HPC Assignment: Parallel Sorting in OpenMP and MPI

31/05/2019

The source code for the various sorting algorithms, as well as the random number generator, can be found in the ./src/ directory. Please note that all programs contain a Quicksort function but in the PSRS programs this is just used for validation.

The job batch scripts used to run experiments on the HPC cluster can be found in the ./jobs/ directory.

The raw experimental test results can be found in the ./tests/ directory.

To compile the code, run "make" on the HPC cluster.

To run the experimental tests, run "make serial", "make omp" and "make mpi" on the HPC cluster. Please note that these jobs are configured to run successfully when this code directory is located on my cluster account (hpc07) at the following location: "/home/hpc07/sorting/". If you would like to run them on another account, please change the #SBATCH --output and #SBATCH --error locations in all the job files accordingly.

To clean the bin folder, run "make clean" on the HPC cluster.
